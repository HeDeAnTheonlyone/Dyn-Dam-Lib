# Dyn-Dam-Lib

This Library adds a few functions (two at the moment, more are comming soon) that will make it very easy to deal custom damage.
You only need to change the following settings in the data storage `dynamic_damage:damage Settings` and then use the command
`function dynamic_damage:damage_from_storage` to deal the damage.

Current Settings:
- **entity**   *(any selector, even stuff like `@e[type=husk,tag=jeff,distance=..30,limit=10]` works)*
- **dmg**  *(the damage amount you want to deal)*
